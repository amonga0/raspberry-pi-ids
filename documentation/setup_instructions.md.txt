Raspberry Pi IDS - Setup Instructions

These steps will get the IDS running on a Raspberry Pi:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project root
	git clone https://github.com/amonga0/raspberry-pi-ids.git
	cd raspberry-pi-ids

2. Install Dependencies
	pip install -r documentation/requirements.txt

3. Start packet capture on Pi
	In a terminal window, run:
	sudo python3 packet_sniffer.py

4. Star the dashboard
	In a second terminal window, run:
	sudo python3 ids_dashboard.py
	
	And visit the dashboard in your browser at:
	https://<your_pi_ip>:5000 (to find your Pi's IP, run hostname -I)

5. *Optional* Use tcpdump, ping, netcat, etc. to simulate suspicious traffic
	From your laptop, run:
	ping <your_pi_ip> (ICMP traffic)
	nc -vz <your_pi_ip> 23 (traffic on Port 23, marked as suspicious, must have netcat installed)
